### Phase 0 — Codegen spine  `[L]`  ✅ **done** (go/no-go on the architecture: **go**)

Lexer/parser for a minimal concrete-typed core (`: ;`, literals, arithmetic,
comparisons, `if/else/end` (originally `if/else/then`; the closer was renamed to `end`
in Slice 4), the core stack
shuffles `dup`/`drop`/`swap`/`over`/`rot`
(monomorphic, int-only here; widened later), and `| locals |`). Compile-time virtual
stack → a
backend-neutral IR → **QBE** IL → `qbe` → system assembler + linker → native binary.
No LLVM, no hand-written native backend. Keep the IR's `Ptr[T]` abstract from the
start so a WASM sibling lowering can be added later. Static stack-effect (arity)
checking. One concrete int type, no heap.
**Exit (met):** `gcd`, `factorial`, and `lerp` compile to standalone native binaries
and run correctly (`5` / `120` / `30`), plus a negative golden for the stack-effect
diagnostic. Proved the virtual-stack → IR → QBE → native path end-to-end.
