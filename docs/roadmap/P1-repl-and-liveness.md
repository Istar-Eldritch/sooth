### Phase 1 — REPL and liveness  `[M]`  ✅ **done**

No in-process JIT (that left with LLVM), and no comptime interpreter (there are no
immediate words; see DESIGN Declined). The REPL runs on the **backend** via `dlopen`:
each new word is compiled to a shared object and loaded into the live session, so the
process holds natively-compiled code it can call at once; redefinition loads a new
object and swaps the name→symbol entry. Whole-program `run` uses compile-to-binary +
subprocess. Factor's in-image model minus the sub-millisecond compile, without owning
a backend.
**Exit (met):** define/test words interactively; redefinition works; the first
throwaway-but-real interactive session exists.
**Dogfood (met):** a tiny interactive calculator session (`tests/phase1.rs`,
`calculator_session_dogfood`).
