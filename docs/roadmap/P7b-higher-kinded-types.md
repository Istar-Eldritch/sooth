### Phase 7b — Higher-kinded types  `[L]`  `[type-class abstraction over type constructors]`

Sooth's traits dispatch on concrete types, monomorphized per instantiation. `Ord` works
because `cmp ( 'T 'T -- Ordering )` is monomorphic within each `impl:` — the trait's type
variable binds to one concrete type. But a `Functor` trait needs to abstract over a *type
constructor* (`Option`, `List`), not a type (`Option[i64]`): its `map` has the signature
`'F['T] ~[ 'T -- 'U ] -- 'F['U]`, where `'F` has kind `* -> *` and the output is a *different
concrete type* from the input. No type variable in Sooth today ranges over anything but a
concrete type (kind `*`), so this signature cannot be expressed.

The motivation is sharing combinator bodies — `map`, `bind`, `filter` — across `Option`,
`Result`, `List`, and future container types without per-type duplication. Each container's
combinators are 3-5 `inline` words today, and the duplication is small (maybe 60 lines across
all containers), but the abstraction is the kind of type-system work the language exists to
explore, and the craft project's principle is that the author's enjoyment is a valid reason
to build something.

**No language at Sooth's scale does this.** No concatenative, statically typed, linear,
systems-targeted language has higher-kinded polymorphism. The languages that do (Haskell)
built the entire type system around it; the closest relative on the linear + systems axis
(Rust) has spent 10+ years on GATs and still cannot express `Functor` cleanly. Sooth is
unusually well placed: whole-program monomorphization means the winning `impl:` is chosen
statically per instantiation with no cross-unit coherence question, and the absence of
lifetimes and associated types removes the two soundness hazards that make specialization
and HKT hard in Rust. That makes the implementation tractable, not the design small.

**Prerequisites:** P7.S4 (polymorphic impl targets — the constructor-keyed dispatch builds on
its machinery for matching a polymorphic target against a concrete type), P7.S3o (bound dispatch on a
poly combinator's own type variable — landed; P7b.S3 extends its per-splice resolution to
constructor applications), and
P7.S6a (length parameters in `type:` headers and the `Kind` type — S6a introduces the
`Kind` enum replacing `VarKind`, the `: Kind` annotation syntax at binding sites, and the
`Len` kind. P7b extends this foundation with `Arrow` for higher kinds; it does not
re-introduce a separate kind mechanism).

**Sequencing:** independent of P8 (packages) and P9 (stdlib layers). May be taken up any time
after P7.S4 lands, by the craft principle of reordering by what you want to play with first.

## The five pieces

1. **Kinds** — every `Type` and every type variable carries a kind (`*`, `* -> *`,
   `* -> * -> *`, and `Len`). The parser annotates type-variable declarations with kinds
   (inferred from usage context: if `'F` appears in `'F['T]`, its kind is `* -> *`, with
   explicit annotation as fallback), the checker validates kind-correctness at every type
   application site, and the IR's monomorphization resolves constructor applications to
   concrete types. The `Kind` enum and the `: Kind` binding-site annotation are introduced by
   **P7.S6a** with `Star` and `Len` variants; P7b.S1 adds `Arrow` for higher kinds. No new
   annotation syntax — the same `'N: Len` shape extends to `'F: * -> *`.

2. **Type-level application** — a new `Type` variant or resolution step that lets `'F['T]`
   appear in signatures and survive checking. Today `Type` is always concrete after binding
   (`Struct(StructId, &'static str)`, etc.); an abstract application form must survive
   checking and resolve during instantiation when both `'F` and `'T` are concrete. Sooth
   already has type-level application in the form of generic instantiation — `Option[i64]`
   is already an "application" of the Option constructor to i64, resolved eagerly during
   monomorphization. HKT requires the type system to handle the case where the constructor
   itself is a type variable.

3. **Constructor-keyed dispatch** — `resolve.rs` and `check/poly.rs` key trait lookup on
   `(TraitId, concrete Type)` today. For `impl: Functor for Option`, the registry needs to
   key on `(TraitId, ConstructorId)` and re-instantiate the constructor's type variables at
   the call site. P7.S4's polymorphic-impl-target machinery — matching a parameterized target
   against a concrete type — is the foundation this builds on.

4. **Higher-kinded trait declarations** — the trait syntax needs to express that `'F` has
   kind `* -> *` and that `map`'s output is `'F['U]`. This is the parser/checker surface:
   `trait: Functor 'F` with a member `map ( 'F['T] ~[ 'T -- 'U ] -- 'F['U] )`, and an
   `impl: Functor for Option` whose body eliminates and reconstructs with the mapped type.

5. **Inline + HKT bounds** — if `Functor.map` is to splice (and it should, to avoid the frame
   tax that already costs `cmp.sth`'s comparisons ~2x over inline), P7.S3o's bound-carrying
   splice machinery extends to handle constructor applications in the output type. An inline
   word with an HKT bound splices at the call site with zero frame cost, the same way array
   combinators do today.

## Slices

**P7b.S1 — Kinds and type-level application.**
The type-system foundation. Type variables may carry higher kinds; `'F['T]` is a type-level
application that type-checks and monomorphizes. Kind inference from usage context, with
explicit annotation as fallback. Kind-incorrect application is a located error. Builds on
the `Kind` enum and `: Kind` annotation syntax that **P7.S6a** introduces — S6a plants
`Star` and `Len`; P7b.S1 adds `Arrow` for higher kinds (`* -> *`, `* -> * -> *`).
**Exit:** a type variable may have a higher kind; `'F['T]` type-checks and monomorphizes to
a concrete type; kind-incorrect application is a located error; a signature may mention
`'F['T]` where `'F` is a type variable of kind `* -> *`.
Scoped against the tree 260830 (probe round + paper recon): see
[slice1-brief](./P7b/slice1-brief.md) — design rulings R1-R8, witnesses, and the golden
list — and [slice1-probes](./P7b/slice1-probes.md) for the verbatim compile-probe log.
Headline: applied-target impl dispatch already works (`impl: Functor for Option[i64]`),
which narrows S2 to the constructor-abstract target; S1's parse work is the prerequisite
for the whole trait surface.

**P7b.S2 — Constructor-keyed dispatch and higher-kinded trait declarations.**
The trait machinery. The impl registry keys on `(TraitId, Constructor)` for HKT traits. A
trait may declare a type variable with a higher kind and use type-level application in member
signatures. An `impl:` target names a constructor, and the impl is instantiated per call site
with the call's concrete type arguments.
**Exit:** `trait: Functor 'F` with `map ( 'F['T] ~[ 'T -- 'U ] -- 'F['U] )` type-checks;
`impl: Functor for Option` resolves; a call to `map` on `Option[i64]` with `~[ i64 -- bool ]`
dispatches to the Option impl and produces `Option[bool]`; the same call on `Result[i64 Err]`
dispatches to a separate `impl: Functor for Result` and produces `Result[bool Err]`.

**P7b.S3 — Inline + HKT bounds (the zero-cost splice).**
Extends P7.S3o's bound-carrying splice to handle constructor applications in output types. An
inline word with an HKT bound splices at the call site with zero frame cost, matching the IR
a hand-written inline `map` would produce. P7.S3o has landed (bound dispatch reaches
spliced combinator bodies), so this slice extends a working mechanism.
**Exit:** `Functor.map` called through a bound on an inline word splices to the same IR as a
hand-written inline `map` would produce; no call frame; no runtime dispatch.

**Dogfood:** implement `Functor` for `Option`, `Result`, and `List`; write a program that
`map`s over all three through a shared `Functor` bound; the compiled output matches hand-written
inline equivalents instruction-for-instruction.

## Out of scope

GATs (generic associated types), associated types, dependent types, polymorphic kind recursion,
kind polymorphism. `Applicative` and `Monad` are library work once the machinery exists, not
type-system slices — declaring them is writing more `trait:`/`impl:` blocks, not extending the
checker. One open question: `Monad.bind`'s signature `bind ( 'F['T] ~[ 'T -- 'F['U] ] -- 'F['U] )`
has a quotation whose effect type contains a higher-kinded application (`'F['U]` as an output);
whether the quotation effect machinery handles this for free or needs its own extension is a
question for S2's brief. A `Default` or `Empty` trait for construction is a separate ordinary
(kind `*`) trait, not HKT, and not part of this phase.
